# Chapter 2 - Introduction to C

## What is C?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A short history on C, it was created by **Dennis Ritchie** at the Bell 
Laboratories and it is one of the more foundational languages used 
in modern times. It has high-level constructs, can handle low-level 
activities, produces efficient programs, and can be compiled on a 
variety of computers. Despite being old, it remains as a very popular 
language, even being considered as the Mother of All Programming 
Languages. C is a fundamental language in the field of Computer Science,
and learning C can make it easier for you to learn other popular 
programming languages such as Python, C++, Java and more. Plenty of 
languages have influences by C, borrowing syntax/features directly or 
indirectly from C.

## What is C used for?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
C has a multitude of uses in Computer Science. It’s main uses are:
- Building Databases
- Designing Compilers
- Developing Operating Systems
- Graphical User Interface
- Game and Animations

######

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
However, new languages have been made to specialize in those main uses, 
and some are better than C in those cases. But understanding the 
fundamentals of C can help bridge a new programmer into different kinds 
of fields, making the learning process easier as you already have a 
base understanding on the ins and outs of programming. And because C 
has been around for a long time, plenty of programmers contributed to C 
by making libraries, making different functions easier to implement as 
you can use existing libraries instead of making your own.

## Low Level Language

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
What makes C so interesting compared to other languages is that C is 
a **Low Level Language**. This means that you can directly manipulate the 
registers and memory of the computer to execute certain instructions. 
What you write down is exactly what you’ll get from the program. It is 
closer to machine code and hardware than High-Level Languages like C++ 
and Python. You have direct control over the computer’s hardware 
resources (like RAM), allowing programmers to write code at a more 
granular level.

## What to expect

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
From 21 Programming, you can expect to learn so much about the things C 
offers. You will start by learning the basics of data, creating and 
manipulating variables to your liking. Mathematics is a key component 
of Computer Science, so you will be learning how to do math in your 
programs as almost every program will include some sort of math in it. 
You will learn how to make inputs and outputs so that you can see how 
your program responds to different use-cases. Once you master the basics,
you can move on to more challenging concepts such as Arrays, Functions, 
and Pointers. But once you know and understand the basics, you can 
basically write any code that you want. 

######

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Keep in mind that as much as you can do in C, there are limitations. 
Programs being able to do EXACTLY what you tell them to is both a 
blessing and a curse. Bugs will be common in your journey so don’t be 
discouraged when you encounter any. Bugs are unexpected problems with 
the program and are a crucial part of any programmer. No matter how good 
you are in programming and coding, bugs are bound to happen. The best 
thing we can do as Computer Science students is to learn why this bug 
happens and find a solution around this bug without destroying the idea 
of the algorithm.
