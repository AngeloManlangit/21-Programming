# Chapter 10 - Functions Introduction

## What are Functions?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In programming, functions are an essential component of efficient code. 
Functions are “self-contained” modules of code that accomplish a 
specific task. Functions usually take in data, process it, and return 
a result. Once a function is written, it can be used as much as you want 
as long as it gets *“called”* in code. This makes it easier for the 
programmer to read code and do certain actions that might happen more 
than once without having to rewrite it.

## Uses  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Functions have a multitude of uses. main() itself is a function to 
indicate to the compiler to indicate the start of the program. printf() 
and scanf() are also functions that make use of parameters to output 
and input values in the code. Functions are written to make the program 
have sub-steps within the algorithm. We reuse the code again and again 
in a clean manner. You can tell that it is a function if it has partheses ().

## Parameters and Arguments

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Functions have parameters and arguments, which are values that are 
given to the function to be manipulated or used within the code. 
**Parameters** are the variables in the declaration of the function. 
These tell the compiler what data types and variable names are asked 
for by the function. **Arguments** refer to the actual value that is being 
passed to the function. These are the values when the function is 
called in a different function like main().

## Function Calls

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We can use the function anywhere in the code. The function will act as 
long as we call it within the code. Sometimes, the function has 
parameters. In that case, we need to call the function with arguments 
that fit those parameters. Learning how to master function calls can 
lead you to becoming a better programmer. What is the use of a function 
if it won’t be called in your program? In the next chapter, you will 
learn how to make your own custom functions.
