## C vs C++ 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now that you know the majority of what C has to offer, it is time to 
level up with C++! However, the journey to learning C++ is a long one 
as C++ has so much more to learn and has an entirely different syntax 
compared to C. The idea and flow of the program remains the same, but 
there are key differences between C and C++. One of them being that C++ 
is has an Object-Oriented approach to programming. Additionally, there 
are some concepts in C that have some additional features in C++ such 
as structs in C being similar to classes in C++ but classes do so much 
more than just storing data. Learning C++ can be tough, but knowing C 
will definitely make your experience with C++ easier and more enjoyable 
at times.

## Object-Oriented Programming

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming model that is common 
in famous programming languages such as Python, Javascript, and C++. 
OOPs organize data as objects rather than having functions and logic. 
This means that variables have direct access to functions without 
having to call them or make them an argument for a function. This is 
more focused on manipulating the object itself rather than letting 
logic do it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
OOPs are beneficial for collaboration where projects are divided into 
groups as you can focus more on the individual objects instead of the 
logic that might affect different parts of the code. It also makes the 
code more reusable, scalable, and efficient. In OOP, objects are labeled 
with a class which gives that object access to different functions 
and methods that manipulate the value of the object.

## Thank you for using 21 Programming!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There is still so much more to learn about both C and C++, and 
Computer Science as a whole. I hope your journey with us in CMSC 11 
and 21 was just as fun (and sometimes painful) as ours was. To all the 
students that made it this far: thank you. We hope that you learnt 
something new or maybe even got to master one of the concepts discussed 
in 21 Programming. We hope that this makes your programming experience 
much more enjoyable and your passion for learning never ends. Best of 
luck!
